# NA7Q builds are manually merged to keep up to date with the original source code
Only minor modifications are done to the source code. Thanks to all the developers who have made this firmware possible and made it open source!

# OpenGD77
Open source firmware for the Radioddity GD-77 dual band DMR / FM handheld transceiever, for Amateur Radio use.

Note. The AMBE codec used by DMR is not open source. This firmware uses binary sections from the official firmware for the AMBE encoding and decoding functions. However all other parts of the code are open source

# Project status

The firmware is relatively stable and provides DMR and FM audio transmission and reception, as well as a DMR hotspot mode.
However it does currently support some core functionality that the official firmware supports, including sending and receiving of text messages, or Dual Capacity Direct operation, or Dual Watch operation etc

Not all functionality provided in the official firmware is likely ever to be part of this firmware, because some features like encryption are explicitly prohibited for Amateur Radio operators.

Some functionality like Dual Watch may also not ever be implemented, because its equivalent to the Channel / Zone scan function.



The project is under active development by several developers. 
New developers are welcome to participate, but currently the focus is still on getting the core functionality working and existing bugs fixed.
This does not mean that new non-core functionality changes will be rejected, but bug fixes and core functionality PR's  will take priority
